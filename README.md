# Decision-Tree-Classifier
Demonstration of Decision Tree algorithm

Decision Tree is a tree based algorithm used for both classification and regression problems in Machine Learning. The objective of this project is to build a decision tree classifier on the Iris data set and evaluate the model performance using Accuracy, Precession, Recall and F1 scores. 

The intution that the decision trees are sensitive to the smallest change in the training data is also discussed by visualizing the fully grown trees.
